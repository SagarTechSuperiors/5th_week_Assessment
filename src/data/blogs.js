A good T-shirt is the foundation of every wardrobe. But not all tees are created equal. Understanding fit, fabric, and stitching can help you make better shopping choices.

1. Choose the Right Fabric
Cotton is breathable and soft, while blends add stretch and durability. For premium comfort, look for organic or bio-washed cotton.
2. Understand T-Shirt Fits
Regular fit works for most body types, slim fit gives a tailored look, and oversized tees are trending for streetwear lovers.
3. Look at Stitching Quality  
Double-stitched hems and reinforced necklines improve longevity and prevent sagging.
4. Pick Colors That Suit You
Neutrals like black, white, beige, and navy are timeless, while seasonal colors can freshen up your collection.

A perfect T-shirt is where comfort meets confidence—and it all starts with quality.
